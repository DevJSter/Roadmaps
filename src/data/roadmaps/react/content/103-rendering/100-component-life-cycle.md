# Component Life Cycle

Each component has several “lifecycle methods” that you can override to run code at particular times in the process. You can use this [lifecycle diagram](https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/) as a cheat sheet. In the list below, commonly used lifecycle methods are marked as bold. The rest of them exist for relatively rare use cases.
