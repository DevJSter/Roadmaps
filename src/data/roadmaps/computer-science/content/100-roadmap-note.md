# Readme

Please note that this is a study plan for software engineering, not web development, we have [separate roadmaps for web development](/), if you are interested.

It's not an exhaustive list and is a highly opinionated list of topics. The roadmap is still a work in progress and we will continue to improve it further. I would love to hear your feedback and suggestions for improving this roadmap.

Please [create an issue with your suggestions](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/issues) or [reach out to me on twitter](https://twitter.com/kamranahmedse) with your feedback and suggestions for improving this roadmap further.
