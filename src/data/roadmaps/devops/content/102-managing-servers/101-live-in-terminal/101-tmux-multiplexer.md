# Tmux

Tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen. Tmux may be detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached.

When tmux is started it creates a new session with a single window and displays it on screen. A status line at the bottom of the screen shows information on the current session and is used to enter interactive commands.

See `man tmux` further information
