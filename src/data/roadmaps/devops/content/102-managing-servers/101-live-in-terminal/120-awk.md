# awk

`awk` is a general-purpose scripting language used for manipulating data or text and generating reports in the Linux world. It is mostly used for pattern scanning and processing. It searches one or more files to see if they contain lines that match the specified patterns and then performs the associated actions.

It has the below syntax:

`awk options 'selection_criteria {action}' input-file > output-file` e.g. `$ awk '{print}' file.txt`
