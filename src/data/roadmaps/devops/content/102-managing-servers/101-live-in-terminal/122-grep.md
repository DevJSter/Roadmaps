# grep

The `grep` command (**g**lobal search for **r**egular **e**xpression and **p**rint out) searches file(s) for a particular pattern of characters, and displays all lines that contain that pattern. It can be used with other commands like `ps` making it more useful.

It has the following syntax:

`$ grep [options] pattern [files]` e.g. `$ grep "search-regex" file-1.txt`
