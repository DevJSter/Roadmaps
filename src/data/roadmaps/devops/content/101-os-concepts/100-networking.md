# Networking

Computer networking refers to interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources with each other. These networked devices use a system of rules, called communications protocols, to transmit information over physical or wireless technologies.

Begin by studying the [OSI Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model). This model will assist in constructing an understanding of the linked topics, and help you contextualize the items linked to the Networking, Security, and Protocols node. Higher level networking concepts may be implemented and named differently across cloud providers. Don't let this confuse you - the basics of TCP/IP are useful and used in the same ways across all implementations.
